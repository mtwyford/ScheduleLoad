# ScheduleLoad
Help Caleb with cleaning up xls  - transpose each student to mult rows, then load to a csv file

# update
will modify the code soon enout - but changed the delimiter between last and first names from a comma to a question mark - so as to not interfere with the load into excel.

now - load csv into excel - it will split the data into columns using the column delimiter -
 then, find and replace the question mark with a comma
 and name will apear correctly.
